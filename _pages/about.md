## About Me

Iâ€™m an apsiring data scientist, experienced with Python and R programming. I specialize in quantitative marketing and economics, applying machine learning and econometric methods to better understand consumer behavior from the large data. Currently, I am working on master's degree in [Computational Social Science at UChicago](https://macss.uchicago.edu/). Before that, I completed BS in Mathematics and BA in Economics at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) in 2018.

I love working on data projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!
