Iâ€™m an apsiring data scientist, experienced with Python and R programming. I specialize in quantitative marketing and economics, applying machine learning and econometric methods to better understand consumer behavior from the large data. Currently, I am working on master's degree in Computational Social Science at UChicago. Before that, I completed BS in Mathematics and BA in Economics at Indiana University Bloomington in 2018.

I love working on data projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!
