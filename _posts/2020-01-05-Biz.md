## Data Policy

* Ethics

* Data governance
  
1. Capability that enables an organization to ensure that high data quality exists throughout the complete lifecycle of the data
  
2. Focus areas of data governance include availability, usability, consistency, data integrity and data security

## Algorithmic Marketing

### Decisions and Algorithms

  * "An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values as output." ---CLRS Algorithms Textbook
  
  * "Algorithmic marketing refers to the use of computational methods to make, implement, monitor or improve marketing decisions based on available informational inputs." ---Sanjog Misra
  
  * A **decision** is an algorithm that outputs choices as a function of inputs to attain a goal (d = f(outcome, choices, models, data...)).
  
  * Building algorithms and softwares at scale to make decisions automatically, rather than people make decisions and repeat the process. (HOTW: "hands off the wheel" @ Amazon)
  
  * Prediction != Decision (Prediction relies on finding patterns in the ast data; Decision is much more complex and uncertain)
  
  * Steps: Objectives -> Theory -> Model -> Data -> Methods -> Implementation -> Monitoring -> Adaptation
  
   (Chicago approach: Theory before the Model and Data)
   
  * Example: 
  
  Objective: max profits
  
  Theory (Data Generating Process): 
  
  1. $$\pi = R - C = P*Q-MC*Q-FC = (P-MC)*Q(P...)-FC $$
  
  2. Consumers maxmize utility when making choices
  
  Model: Demand function/Discrete choice, $$Q = a+b*P+\epsilon$$ 
  
  (In marketing, we are interested in predicting a and b, as they tell us how P changes Q)
  
  Data: Collect data on price experiments
  
  Methods: Optimization

<img src="/images/Biz/Equation.png" class="img-responsive" alt=""> 

```r
Ex. Find the optimal price

pstar = function (a=10, b=-2, mc=1){
  # Quantity Demand Function
  q = function(p){return(a+b*p)}  
  rev = function(p){return(p*q(p))}
  cost = function(p){return(mc*q(p))}
  profit = function(p){return (rev(p) - cost(p))}
  result = optimize(profit, lower=1, upper=10, tol=1e-10, maximum = TRUE)
  pstar = result$maximum
  return(pstar)
}

# Call the function
pstar()
# optimal price is 3

curve(profits, 1, 10)
# Find Minimum
res = optimize(profits,interval=c(1,10), maximum=TRUE)
# Plot that point
points(x=res$maximum, y=res$objective,pch=19,col='red',cex=1.5)


# Stimulate data
set.seed = 1000
N = 1000
ps = runif(N) # prices as uniform random number between 0 and 1
qs = 10 - 2*ps + rnorm(N)
out = lm(qs~ps)
summary(out)
cf = coef(out)
pstar(cf[1], cf[2], 1)
# optimal price is 2.94
```

## Behavioral Economics/Consumer Behavior

### Heuristics and Biases

#### Prospect Theory

* Also known as "loss-aversion theory"
  
* Psychological theory of decision-making under conditions of risk
  
* Original paper: [Kahneman and Tversky, 1979 in Econometrica](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~camerer/Ec101/ProspectTheory.pdf)
 
* For investors:

1. The prospect theory says that investors value gains and losses differently, placing more weight on perceived gains versus perceived losses.

2. An investor presented with a choice, both equal, will choose the one presented in terms of potential gains.

3. The prospect theory is part of behavioral economics, suggesting investors chose perceived gains because losses cause a greater emotional impact.

4.The certainty effect says individuals prefer certain outcomes over probable ones, while the isolation effect says individuals cancel out similar information when making a decision.

From [Investopedia-Prospect Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prospecttheory.asp)

#### Reference-Dependent Preferences
 
when utility from an outcome depends on comparisons to relevant “reference levels” or “reference points.”

#### Loss Aversion

people dislike losses relative to the reference point more than they like same-sized gains.

### Present-Biased Preferences (Self Control)

### Fairness

### Peer Effects

### Status Concerns

### Psychology of Incentives

### Behavioral Development

### Biased Beliefs (Overconfidence, Projection Bias, Emotion, etc.)

### Salience and Attention

### Prejudice and Discrimination

### Behavioral Finance

### Behavioral Household Finance

### Policy and Choice Architecture
