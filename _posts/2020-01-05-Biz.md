  Decisions and Algorithms
</summary>
<br>
  “An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values as output." ---CLRS Algorithms Textbook
  
  "Algorithmic marketing refers to the use of computational methods to make, implement, monitor or improve marketing decisions based on available informational inputs." ---Sanjog Misra
  
  A decision is an algorithm that outputs choices as a function of inputs to attain a goal.
  
  Prediction != Decision (Prediction relies on finding patterns in the ast data; Decision is much more complex and uncertain)
  
  Steps:
  
  Objectives -> Theory -> Model -> Data -> Methods -> Implementation -> Monitoring -> Adaptation

Heuristics and Biases

<details>
<summary> 
Prospect Theory
</summary>
<br>
  Also known as "loss-aversion theory"
  
  psychological theory of decision-making under conditions of risk
  
First paper: [Kahneman and Tversky, 1979 in Econometrica](http://www.its.caltech.edu/~camerer/Ec101/ProspectTheory.pdf)
 
 
For investors:

* The prospect theory says that investors value gains and losses differently, placing more weight on perceived gains versus perceived losses.
* An investor presented with a choice, both equal, will choose the one presented in terms of potential gains.
* The prospect theory is part of behavioral economics, suggesting investors chose perceived gains because losses cause a greater emotional impact.
* The certainty effect says individuals prefer certain outcomes over probable ones, while the isolation effect says individuals cancel out similar information when making a decision.
