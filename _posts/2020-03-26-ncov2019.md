This is an on-going open source project on studying the social science aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as organizations' policy reactions, people's attitudes towards policy, economic/societal impact, and so on.

There are growing number of predictive models and analysis for the COVID-19 pandemic. However, their results differ and rely on various assumptions. Meanwhile, policy makers should inform the public what models they rely on and how they use the model to make the decision (such as lockdown).

At current stage, I am collecting and evaluating the online projects, data, paper, and models on how organizations makes decisions to react to COVID-19. 

Later on, I am interested to understand the "trust" issue better during this pandemic. For example, 

* why do the public ignore/distrust local/federal governments' decisions? 

* How much should we (the public) and the policy makers trust the models for the spread of COVID-19? 

* How do the public choose trustworthy sources of information (such as news/social media/experts/think tanks/governemnt/CDC)?
