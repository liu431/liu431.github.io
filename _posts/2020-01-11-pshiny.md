[Our website prototype (Github page and Sketch)](https://pshiny.github.io/)

Pshiny is a platform for sharing student projects to the public. 

I came up with this idea in November 2019 while I was editting my projects for my personal website. I suddenly realized that a central platform of projects would help students improve their work by peer comments and generate social impact by sharing the insights and findings to the public.

Meanwhile, the Data Analytics Team at Harris School of Public Policy is planning HarrisHack[https://www.harrishack.com/]. As Harris School’s inaugural hackathon, HarrisHack welcomes students who are interested at building products that could directly impact the students’ experiences. So I signed up for the event and started to form my team. On Nov 8th, I took the lead to be the first person to pitch at the HarrisHack Pitch Event. I met [Mark Amobi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/markdamobi/) and [Anirudh (Rudy) Sriram](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirudh-sriram-77a796107/) there and was delighted that they were on board. . On Nov 14th, I pitched at a Polsky new venture event  and received many insightful comments from young entrepreneurs. In the next two week, I also reached out to other participants and welcomed [Daniela Matinho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielamatinho/) and [Chun Hu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chun-hu/) to the team. 

Now that we had a team, the real work began. Despite the final weeks and holiday, we brainstormed many exciting ideas through tons of emails and Slack messages. On the one side, this was very encouraging because it showed opportunities in this market. On the other side, we needed to prioritize on the most feasible and important features. On Dec 20th, we wrote up our [proposal](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/liu431/liu431.github.io/blob/master/images/pshiny/Proposal.pdf) that later won us the best idea award! During the process, our idea was iterated many times and became much more mature than my initial idea.

On Jan 10th, all 5 of us finally met together at the hackathon. As we already had idea to work on, the challenge what should we build in 24 hours for the presentation. It would be too demanding to code the platform website from scratch. Luckily, our mentor [Ozan Gokdemir](https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/people/profile/ozan-gokdemir/) suggested us to use Sketch to design the UI. As I also had experience with the Github Page for my personal website, we decided to combine the two together to design the [website](https://pshiny.github.io/). Another interesting experiment we did was to collect other teams' idea and tried to put them online. Put it simply, we wanted to show the audience that Pshiny is "project of projects" and it enables students and the public to have access to these exciting projects going on at the hackathon.





### Team Name: Pshiny

“P” refers to anything that demonstrates your personal accomplishments, such as projects (class projects,
thesis, HarrisHack projects...), portfolios, products, (software) programs, posters...
(We will use “projects” as a reference to all possible “P” in this proposal.)
Pshiny helps you P shiny by storytelling.

### Problem Statement
As students in the master programs, we have finished many projects that we are proud of. However, there
is no central platform for us to showcase our projects. We also could get very limited feedback from peers
or instructors. It’s also difficult to show the projects to the employers as they are too complex.

### Description of idea

Albert Einstein once said: “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough”. As a
result, Pshiny is a platform for students to present their projects simply. Pshiny aims to help students have
an effective channel to present their projects in an engaging manner and at the same time improve their
ability to communicate their work. There are two parts that achieve this goal, which focuses on writing
and getting critiques.

The first part is a social media website where students could post summaries of their projects concisely.
We call this the elevator pitch of your projects as the students have to explain the project with limited
characters and key visualizations. Although the students could add links to the full paper or all codes on
Github, they have to think about how to let other readers understand and get impressed by your projects in
three minutes.

The second part would the matching algorithm that matches students to critique each other’s projects.
Pshiny will match students ideally from very different fields to encourage students to write projects
without too much technical jargon and universally understandable. Of course, these projects will be open
to all other students to provide feedback. The website would also allow messaging between different
students for more private discussions.

The target audience is primarily students who want to showcase their work in an attractive manner while
improving their ability to better communicate their past projects. Our first batch of students would be
from programs in Public Policy, Computational Social Science, Analytics, Social Science, Computer
Science, MBA, Statistics, etc.

Our long term goal with this project is to attract employers, who would be able to view the portfolios of
the students on the PShiny website. Employers would also be able to suggest sample projects that students
could work on, and post on their portfolios, which would allow employers to be able to better evaluate
students’ relevant abilities. The platform would act as an engaging way for employers to view and
understand students’ past work. As it is often quoted, it is a lot better to show than to tell. In this case, a
portfolio with visualizations and an engaging UI would do a lot more for students than a few bullet points
in a resume.

### Value Proposition

There are three main outcomes for students to join Pshiny.
The first outcome is showcasing your work in a simple, engaging and attractive manner. These will be
especially useful for students who are looking for jobs, as they can provide links to their Pshiny portfolio
on their resume, Linkedin and so on.
The second outcome is improving students’ ability to communicate and present their projects while
getting peer feedback. This is especially important for students preparing for interviews or presentations.
PShiny would also provide assistance and writing tips to help students learn the best practices.
The third but certainly not the least important outcome is the ability to network with people from your
field, and beyond. Most of the students work alone in their projects. Pshiny believes that there should be
more interdisciplinary conversations between students in different fields. Pshiny enables this conversation
by encouraging students to critique others’ work and messaging. Potentially, students would get new
ideas by methods from other fields or find collaborators who are interested in similar topics.

### Data

The data will come from the users. Before students post on Pshiny, they will fill out a form, answering
questions such as their background, categories of projects, subjects, what kind of critiques they are
looking for, and so forth. Pshiny will use this information to enable matching between different users and
also provide recommendations for other projects you may find interesting and useful to read.
We also plan to survey about 50 students online in the relevant programs before the hackathon. In
particular, we will estimate the market demand and further decide what functions are most important for
the website.

### Roadmap
Firstly, we aim to create the prototype for Pshiny using online tools such as Figma or InVision. We will
also use the hackathon time to brainstorm ideas and design the pages. To achieve this goal, we plan to
discuss and learn the new tools before the hackathon. We want to use the time during the hackathon to
efficiently implement our ideas and also receive feedback from mentors and peers.
Secondly, we will design marketing strategies for getting students to post on websites. We will also
analyze the survey data from students to decide the product designs.
