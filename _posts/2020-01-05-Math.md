## Probability

A, B, and C are distinct events; 

X is a random variable that can take different values (Ex. X=1 if an individual is a female and 0 if a male)

P(X=1): probability that an individual randomly drawn from a population is female, which corresponds to the proportion of the population that are female

### Marginal probability

0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1

P(A) + P(Ā) = 1, where Ā denotes all other events that are not A

### Joint Probability

$$P(A, B) = P(A) * P(B \mid A)$$

P(A, B) = 0 if A and B are mutually exclusive; B = Ā)

Chain rule: $$P(A, B, C) = P(A) * P(B \mid A) * P(C \mid B,A)$$

### Conditional probability

$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A,B)}{P(A)}$$

### Statistical independence

If A and B are statistically independent events, then P(B|A) = P(B) and P(A,B) = P(A) * P(B)

### Bayes’ Theorem

$$P(B|A)=\frac{P(A|B) * P(B)}{P(A)}$$

### Probability density for continuous random variables

For a discrete random variable Y, P(Y = y) is the probability that Y takes value y, and $$\sum_{k}^{} 𝑃(Y=y)=1$$

For a continuous random variable Y, 𝑓(𝑦) is the probability density of y, and $$\int_{y}^{}𝑓(𝑦)dy=1$$

### Bayes’ Theorem for continuous random variables X and Y

$$f(y|x) = \frac{f(x,y)}{f(x)} = \frac{f(x|y)f(y)}{f(x)}$$

If x and y are independent, then f(x,y) = f(x)f(y)

## Statistical Inference

### p value

  * A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.

  * A large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

  * p-values very close to the cutoff (0.05) are considered to be marginal (could go either way). Always report the p-value so your readers can draw their own conclusions.

### Law of Large Number

Wiki def: the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed. 

### Central Limit Theorem

Def: probability distribution of the average of independent random variables will converge to a normal distribution, as the number of observations increases
