## Statistical Inference

### p value

  * A small p-value (typically â‰¤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.

  * A large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

  * p-values very close to the cutoff (0.05) are considered to be marginal (could go either way). Always report the p-value so your readers can draw their own conclusions.

### Law of Large Number

Wiki def: the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed. 

### Central Limit Theorem

Def: probability distribution of the average of independent random variables will converge to a normal distribution, as the number of observations increases
